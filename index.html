            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Grief is Just Love With Nowhere to Go</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                I never truly understood grief until I lost my nan. It’s a strange, hollow feeling—like a part of you has been taken away, leaving an emptiness you can’t quite fill. I kept replaying memories, those moments where she made everything feel lighter, more bearable. But when she was gone, all that love I had for her had nowhere to go.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Grief, I’ve realized, is just that—love with nowhere to go. It’s the love we still hold, even when the person is no longer here to receive it. It’s why certain songs or familiar scents can bring back such a wave of emotion, like that love is searching for its home.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Some days, that realization brings comfort. It’s a reminder that my love for her is still there, still strong. Other days, it feels like a weight that sits in my chest, reminding me of everything I miss. But I’ve come to see that this is what grief is—carrying that love forward, even when it hurts.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                If you’re feeling this too, I hope you know that it’s okay. It’s okay to feel the weight of that love, to let it out when it feels too much to carry alone. You’re not alone in this. We all carry our own quiet love, searching for a way to honor those who shaped us, even when they’re no longer here.
